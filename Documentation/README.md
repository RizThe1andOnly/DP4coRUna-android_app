# Contents of Documentation Folder

This folder contains some documentation for the project as well as some extraneous elements that may be helpful for the project going forward.

Folder contains:
- Network Documentation : Some docs explaining the contents of the network directory in the application. This explains the current setup for the networking procedures in our app.
- DP4ProgressDoc : a document detailing the progress of the application up to 9/2020.
- dp4corunadata.db : an instance of a trained in-device sqlite database. This is an sqlite database file that can be used with SQLite Studios inside of a computer. This data (as far as we know) cannot be directly transferred to an android device but may prove helpful. The data here contains data collected at Willowbrook Mall New Jersey.
- SamplePage.php : the php page that was used as an endpoint for our experimentation with an Amazon Web Services (AWS) server and database.
