LocalLearningService->obtainWifiAccessPointsList:
    - fatal error toast cannot be called from thread that hasn't
    called Looper.prepare() in StartMotionSensingHandler inner class.
        - Fix_1 :  a Looper.prepare() will be called in the
        constructor for StartMotionSensingHandler.
            - This should also have looper prepared for HandleMotionDetection
            because these two handler classes are within the same thread.
            --> RESULT : This fix did not work, lack of looper prepare in the handler thread
            was not the problem.
        - Fix_2 : create a thread in MainActivity (what starts the service) and call Looper.prepare() on it.
            --> RESULT : Did not work.
        - Fix_3 : as above for most part but moved the looper.prepare within the LocalLearningService class.
            --> RESULT : Did not work.

        - Will check for which thread is causing problem by using Logs.
            - Service is being created in the main thread.
            - !!! The toast messages are sent from a Timer Thread, which is separate from the handler threads

        - Fix_4 : abandoned toast for testing method
